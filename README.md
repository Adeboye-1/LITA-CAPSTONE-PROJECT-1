## Project 1: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store
Summary: In this project, you are tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store. 
You will need to explore sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional 
performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI 
dashboard that highlights these findings.
Instructions:
1. Excel:
- Perform an initial exploration of the sales data. Use pivot tables to summarize 
total sales by product, region, and month.
- Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and 
total revenue by region.
- Create any other interesting report
2. SQL:
Hint â€“ You need to load the dataset into your SQL Server environment to write and 
validate your queries.
Write queries to extract key insights based on the following questions. 
- retrieve the total sales for each product category.
- find the number of sales transactions in each region.
- find the highest-selling product by total sales value.
- calculate total revenue per product.
- calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.
- find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
- calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
- identify products with no sales in the last quarter.
3. Power BI:
- Create a dashboard that visualizes the insights found in Excel and SQL. The 
dashboard should include a sales overview, top-performing products, and 
regional breakdowns.
